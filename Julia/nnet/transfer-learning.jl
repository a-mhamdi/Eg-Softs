# Here's some example Julia code that demonstrates how to perform transfer learning using a pre-trained model in the Flux.jl library:


using Flux
using Flux.Data.MNIST
using Flux: onehotbatch, onecold
using Flux.Data: DataLoader

# Load the MNIST dataset
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = MNIST.load()

# Convert the images to floating-point tensors
X_train = Flux.data(X_train)
X_test = Flux.data(X_test)

# Normalize the pixel values
X_train = X_train .- 128f0
X_test = X_test .- 128f0

# Convert the labels to one-hot encoding
y_train = onehotbatch(y_train, 0:9)
y_test = onehotbatch(y_test, 0:9)

# Load a pre-trained model
model = Flux.load("pretrained_model.bson")

# Replace the top layer of the model with a new, untrained layer
model.layers[end] = Dense(10, softmax)

# Define the loss function and an optimizer
loss_fn = Flux.crossentropy
opt = Flux.ADAM()

# Train the model
for epoch in 1:10
    for (x, y) in zip(X_train, y_train)
        # Compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the model's parameters
        gs = gradient(params(model)) do
            y_pred = model(x)
            loss_fn(y_pred, y)
        end

        # Update the model's parameters using the optimizer
        Flux.update!(opt, params(model), gs)
    end

    # Calculate the accuracy on the test set
    accuracy = sum(onecold(model(X_test)) .== onecold(y_test)) / length(y_test)

    println("Epoch: $epoch, Accuracy: $accuracy")
end


# This code loads a pre-trained model from a file, replaces the top layer with a new, untrained layer, and fine-tunes the model on the MNIST dataset. The new layer has 10 output units corresponding to the 10 classes in the MNIST dataset.
